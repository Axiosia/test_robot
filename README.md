A simple solution to display the elephant robot Pro 600 in gazebo.

In official channel, the robot model cannot display in gazebo.To my perspective the official document of mashes maybe not meet the gazebo's standard.In this package I replace the dae file to stl file and reset the coordinate system.However the urdf file not not add the moving control part.It remains to be added in your personal urdf files.

You should first create your workspace and create your robot file, then fix the urdf file to meet your file arragement.
